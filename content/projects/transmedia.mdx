title: Strategic Transmedia Expansion
description: >
  Established a governance model that safeguards character evolution, product
  continuity, and data reuse as KIDO grows its stories into games, animation,
  and interactive experiences—ensuring every new format stays canon-aligned and
  asset-efficient.

## Challenge  
As KIDO scaled beyond books, inconsistencies in character arcs and duplicated
art assets threatened brand coherence and budget.

## Strategy  
* Define a **single narrative kernel**: canonical timelines, character arcs,
  and core rules documented once and versioned.  
* Implement **product lifecycle checkpoints**—green-light reviews that verify
  new media pitches against continuity and asset-reuse criteria.  
* Create a **metadata layer** linking every asset (illustration, voice line,
  mechanic) to its narrative source.

## Execution  
1. Deployed a **version-controlled “Character Bible”** (Git + YAML) with diff
   history and semantic tagging.  
2. Integrated the bible into Jira workflows—tickets autolink to narrative IDs
   so designers pull the right canon data.  
3. Established **cross-format style guides** and reuse libraries, cutting new
   sprite creation by 60 %.  
4. Set up quarterly **continuity councils**—writers, producers, and engineers
   resolve proposed divergences before production.

## Outcomes  
* Maintained 100 % continuity across three books, one game prototype, and an
  animated pilot.  
* Asset reuse saved an estimated \$120 k in art and VO budgets for the first
  transmedia cycle.  
* Time to approve new media concepts dropped from four weeks to under one,
  thanks to clear governance gates.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Strategic foresight for narrative ecosystems  
* Narrative-aware systems engineering & asset governance  
* Cross-format product continuity without creative slowdown
