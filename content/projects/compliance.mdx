title: Compliance Systems Blueprint for AI-Driven Platforms
description: >
  Designed and delivered an end-to-end compliance framework for HIPAA-aligned,
  AI-driven mental-performance platforms. Work included internal policy
  templates, data-protection architecture, automated audit logs, and a
  step-by-step incident-response playbook—embedding governance by design and
  reducing regulatory risk.

## Challenge  
AI platforms that process protected health data face intense scrutiny and heavy
penalties for missteps. Chi’Va needed airtight governance without slowing
product velocity.

## Strategy  
* Establish **policy as code**—version-controlled HIPAA, SOC 2, and GDPR
  policies linked to CI gates.  
* Architect data flows with **encryption in transit and at rest**, plus
  automated key rotation.  
* Build an **incident-response runbook** that routes alerts, ownership, and
  evidence gathering within minutes.

## Execution  
1. Authored forty-plus internal policies covering access control, breach
   notification, vendor management, and data-retention.  
2. Integrated AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and QLDB to create a tamper-proof
   audit trail.  
3. Implemented **risk registers** and quarterly tabletop drills to validate the
   playbooks.  
4. Wired compliance checks into the deployment pipeline—builds fail if a policy
   control is violated.

## Outcomes  
* Passed external HIPAA assessment on first attempt with zero high-severity
  findings.  
* Cut evidence-collection time during audits by 70 percent thanks to auto-logged
  controls.  
* Mean time to containment for security incidents now under five minutes,
  verified through drills.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Systems-level compliance strategy  
* Engineering safeguards and automated governance  
* Risk-mitigation processes that scale with product growth
