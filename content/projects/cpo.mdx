#Real-Time Edge Analytics Platform for Democratized Alpha

## Challenge  
Retail traders drown in headline latency and opaque signals, while
institutional-grade streams remain gated behind high fees and NDAs. MarketReader
needed a real-time analytics layer that meets FINRA fair-disclosure standards and
scales to millions of concurrent users without exchange-rule violations.

## Strategy  
* Build a **high-throughput ingestion mesh** that fuses multi-venue trade data
  with alt-data (news sentiment, options flow) in milliseconds.  
* Deploy an **online feature store** plus auto-retraining ML pipelines to detect
  micro-alpha opportunities as they emerge.  
* Add an **explainability layer**—Shapley value scoring + narrative synthesis—
  so every alert shows causal factors regulators can audit.  
* Package outputs into a **tiered API** and white-label widgets for broker
  integration (web & mobile).

## Execution  
1. Negotiated exchange and alt-data contracts, cutting raw-feed latency to
   &lt;5 ms hop.  
2. Led a cross-functional **“ML platform guild”**: data engineers, quants, and
   product designers collaborated on feature pipelines and UI surfacing.  
3. Implemented model-risk governance: bias tests, drift alerts, and kill
   switches wired into CI/CD.  
4. Launched tiered pricing—free delayed feed, real-time retail, and pro API—
   backed by partner GTM playbooks.

## Outcomes  
* Achieved **sub-200 ms end-to-end signal latency** from tick to alert.  
* Secured three retail-broker integrations at launch, putting the platform in
  front of **2.4 million** active accounts.  
* Transitioned revenue mix from 100 % one-off deals to **65 % recurring SaaS**
  within two quarters.  
* Passed FINRA disclosure review with zero findings, thanks to built-in
  explainability.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Chief Product & Data Strategy leadership  
* High-throughput data architecture & auto-retraining ML pipelines  
* Explainable-AI design that satisfies regulatory scrutiny  
* Pricing & GTM frameworks for scalable SaaS subscriptions
