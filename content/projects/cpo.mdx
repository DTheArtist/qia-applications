## Challenge  
Retail and professional traders drown in news feeds yet still miss the **why**
behind sudden price swings. MarketReader needed a low-latency signal engine and
UX that explains moves in plain language.

## Strategy  
* Build a **streaming data platform** ingesting tick-level quotes, options
  flow, and curated news.  
* Train **explainable ML models** that rank drivers by statistical impact and
  confidence.  
* Design a **single-pane dashboard** surfacing signals, context sentences, and
  drill-downs in &lt;2 s from detection to display.

## Execution  
1. Deployed a Kafka + Flink pipeline processing 2 M msgs / s with sub-second
   lag.  
2. Implemented gradient-boosted models plus SHAP scoring for transparent driver
   attribution.  
3. Crafted a React + WebGL visualization layer that streams updates without page
   reloads.  
4. Launched a freemium API tier and self-serve onboarding, reducing sales touch
   for hobby traders.

## Outcomes  
* Platform handles **5 ×** the user load since public beta, maintaining
  99.95 % uptime.  
* Average time from market event to user alert is **1.3 s** (95th percentile).  
* Early adopters report **30 %** faster trade-decision cycles and lower
  headline-risk anxiety.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Streaming data architecture & low-latency ML  
* Product strategy balancing pro-grade power with retail simplicity  
* Scalable, explainable AI delivering actionable market context
