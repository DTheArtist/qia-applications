#Cross-Functional Product Leadership Restructure for Fintech Scaling

## Challenge  
As growth accelerated, overlapping roles and blurred ownership slowed delivery
across the equity-management stack. Leadership needed a clear specialization
framework before headcount doubled.

## Strategy  
* Map the end-to-end product surface into **core equity, liquidity, reporting,
  UX, AI enablement, and admin tools**.  
* Define *responsibility matrices* (RACI) and career tracks for PMs, EMs, and
  designers in each domain.  
* Coach executives on **cross-functional rituals** that keep strategy,
  discovery, and delivery tightly aligned.

## Execution  
1. Ran workshops to surface pain points and value streams, feeding a
   new **product-area charter** for each domain.  
2. Introduced **dual-track agile**: discovery squads feeding validated bets to
   delivery squads, with shared OKRs.  
3. Implemented a *quarterly portfolio review*—finance, product, engineering,
   and design leaders commit to scope and capacity in one forum.  
4. Developed onboarding playbooks so incoming leaders slot quickly into their
   specialization lane.

## Outcomes  
* Cut cycle time for new liquidity features by **32 %**, thanks to focused,
  domain-specific squads.  
* Executive reviews dropped from 3 h to 45 min—decisions routed to the right
  domain leads.  
* Employee engagement survey showed a **25 % increase** in role clarity and
  career-path confidence.  
* Key hires slotted into the refactored structure with &lt;2 weeks ramp-up.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Executive coaching & org-design strategy  
* Product / engineering collaboration frameworks  
* Specialization models that scale without siloing
