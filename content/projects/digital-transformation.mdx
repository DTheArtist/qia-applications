## Challenge

Chi’Va set out to build a neurotech platform capable of delivering AI‑guided mental‑performance protocols at clinical‑grade security and scale.  
Early prototypes proved the concept, but the underlying stack was brittle—data silos, ad‑hoc DevOps, and no clear HIPAA posture were constraining growth.

## Strategy

1. **Modular cloud‑native architecture** – decomposed the monolith into containerized services on AWS Fargate & Lambda managed via IaC (Pulumi).
2. **Unified data layer** – designed a Postgres + DynamoDB hybrid to separate transactional workloads from low‑latency session storage, enabling analytics pipelines without throttling live traffic.
3. **Compliance‑by‑design** – mapped every data flow to HIPAA safeguards, codified encryption‑at‑rest/‑in‑transit, audit logging, and a BAA‑ready vendor matrix.
4. **Automation first** – GitHub Actions CI/CD, infrastructure drift detection, and health‑probe based auto‑rollbacks to keep releases boring.

## Execution Highlights

- **Reference architecture** published in C4 diagrams and ADRs adopted by cross‑functional squads.  
- **Event‑driven metric ingestion** funnels session SUDs, VoC, and belief statements into a normalized schema, powering longitudinal insights.  
- **Zero‑trust perimeter** with AWS Cognito, short‑lived JWTs, and micro‑segmented VPC endpoints.  
- **Cost guardrails** keep monthly infra spend under **US $400** while sustaining **10× user growth**.

## Outcomes
* **75% faster** product iteration cycles post‑refactor.
* **99.99%** uptime across critical services since launch.
* Passed third‑party HIPAA/SOC‑2 readiness audit *on first attempt*.
* Platform now serves **10× user load** with <150 ms median latency.

## What This Demonstrates

- Vision‑level **CTO leadership** translating neuroscience objectives into executable architecture.  
- Mastery of **cloud‑native patterns** and **infrastructure automation**.  
- Proven track record aligning **HIPAA & SOC‑2** requirements with rapid product iteration.
