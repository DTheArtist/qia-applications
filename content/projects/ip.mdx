title: IP-to-Product Pipelines
description: >
  Built a repeatable innovation framework for KIDO PubTech that turns
  intellectual property—beginning with books—into an ecosystem of transmedia
  assets (games, series, apps). Centralized systems for character development,
  asset reuse, and rich metadata now drive long-tail monetization and friction-free
  licensing.

## Challenge  
KIDO PubTech’s growth vision required moving beyond print publishing into
animation, gaming, and interactive media—without losing continuity or
overspending on duplicated creative work.

## Strategy  
* Design a **single “source of truth” repository** for characters, lore, art
  assets, and licensing metadata.  
* Map the full IP lifecycle—ideation → authoring → asset enrichment →
  productization—into discrete, automatable stages.  
* Embed monetization checkpoints and license-ready metadata at every stage to
  unlock downstream revenue without re-tooling.

## Execution  
1. Implemented a **graph-based content hub** (Neo4j + custom API) linking every
   character, location, and story arc.  
2. Automated art-asset pipelines: Figma → Blender → Unity, preserving naming
   and usage rights across exports.  
3. Added **licensing toolkit**: contract templates, rights matrices, royalty
   calculators, and Stripe-powered payouts.  
4. Built dashboards for creators to track asset reuse and for executives to
   forecast revenue by IP segment.

## Outcomes  
* Cut new-media spin-up time from **6 months to 6 weeks**.  
* Increased asset reuse rate **70 %**, reducing art budget for each new game
  build.  
* Enabled simultaneous launch of a picture-book series, mobile game prototype,
  and animated pilot—each drawing from the same canonical data store.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Systems architecture for complex IP ecosystems  
* Long-tail monetization strategy & licensing tech stack  
* Cross-domain workflows that keep creative and engineering teams in sync
