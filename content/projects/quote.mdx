title: Automation Framework
description: >
  Designed and deployed a cloud-native quoting engine for House of Juice that
  replaces spreadsheets with Lambda-powered workflows, hybrid DynamoDB + PostgreSQL
  storage, and real-time dashboards. HTML quotes now auto-generate in seconds,
  cutting manual effort and operational cost.

# Strategic Automation Framework for Quote Lifecycle Management

## Challenge  
House of Juice’s event-service team relied on email threads and Excel sheets to
price corporate activations. The manual process delayed responses, produced
version-control mistakes, and provided no visibility into quote status.

## Strategy  
* Architect a **serverless, event-driven pipeline** on AWS: API Gateway →
  Lambda → DynamoDB for hot reads, with periodic sync to PostgreSQL for
  reporting.  
* Generate **print-ready HTML quotes** on-the-fly to avoid PDF storage and
  bandwidth fees.  
* Build a React dashboard that surfaces quote cards, status buttons, and live
  metrics for managers.

## Execution  
1. **QuoteCalculator Lambda** ingests form data, computes pricing tiers, and
   writes to DynamoDB (JSON) + PostgreSQL (relational).  
2. **QuoteNotifications Lambda** pulls DB entries, renders tailwind-styled HTML,
   emails clients, and updates dashboard cards via WebSocket.  
3. **Cost-aware design**: provisioned concurrency only during business hours,
   S3-cached assets, and IAM least privilege policies.  
4. CI/CD with AWS SAM pipelines and unit tests for price-rule integrity.

## Outcomes  
* Turnaround time for a new quote dropped from **>24 h to ≈2 min**.  
* Managers gained **live visibility** into every quote’s lifecycle; no more
  stale spreadsheets.  
* Infrastructure spend stayed under **$25 mo.** on the AWS Free Tier plus spot
  allocations.  
* Error rate in quote data entry reduced **95 %** through automated validation.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* AWS serverless architecture & hybrid data modeling  
* Workflow automation and real-time dashboards  
* Cost-optimized engineering and resource governance
