## Challenge  
Board-level objectives like “double ARR in two years” or “enter the
enterprise-SaaS tier” arrived without clear scope or technical direction.
Teams risked overbuilding in some areas and starving others.

## Strategy  
* Run a **vision-to-execution sweep**: decode financial targets into customer
  outcomes, roadmap themes, and measurable KPIs.  
* Apply **option-based planning**—multiple scale paths modeled for cost,
  risk, and time-to-impact.  
* Build a **narrative roadmap** that stitches product, platform, and org
  evolution into one story executives can fund and teams can ship.

## Execution  
1. Facilitated cross-functional workshops that reframed objectives into three
   strategic bets and nine supporting initiatives.  
2. Produced a **3-horizon technology map**—foundation hardening, capability
   unlocks, and innovation layers—with annual capex envelopes.  
3. Aligned hiring and vendor decisions to the roadmap, avoiding premature tool
   sprawl.  
4. Installed a **rolling OKR cadence** so progress stays visible and pivots
   happen before drift becomes debt.

## Outcomes  
* Leadership approved the roadmap with full budget in one review cycle.  
* Achieved a **24 % YoY ARR uptick** within the first horizon, tracking ahead
  of the two-year target.  
* Engineering focus scores rose 30 % as teams gained clarity on priorities and
  dependency sequencing.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Executive-level strategy translation  
* Cohesive, scalable technology roadmapping  
* Data-driven foresight that balances ambition with execution reality
