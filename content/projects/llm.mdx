## Challenge  
Chi’Va needed to transform research on large language models into
production-grade features—without runaway token spend or degraded accuracy.

## Strategy  
* Spin up an **internal R&D lane** isolated from core prod, using feature flags
  for safe user opt-in.  
* Build **prompt-engineering templates** that inject session history,
  neuroscience cues, and user metrics deterministically.  
* Instrument every call with **cost & latency dashboards** so experiments are
  judged by precision and spend.

## Execution  
1. Deployed an **Agentic toolkit** (Next.js API routes + LangChain) supporting
   memory recall, state classification, and protocol-step sequencing.  
2. Added vector-store retrieval with embeddings tuned on Chi’Va’s domain
   glossary for higher factuality.  
3. Implemented **dynamic model routing**: GPT-4o for high-stakes steps,
   Claude-Haiku for low-stakes summaries—cutting average cost per session by
   roughly 55 %.  
4. Integrated OpenTelemetry spans to surface token usage, latency, and
   hallucination flags in real time.

## Outcomes  
* Prototype reached **95 % precision** in performance-state classification
  during closed beta.  
* Average inference spend held **under 10 ¢ per user session**.  
* Enabled launch of an LLM-guided “performance check-in” feature in&nbsp;6 weeks
  versus the previous 3-month roadmap estimate.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* AI product strategy & LLM systems design  
* Cost-aware NLP engineering  
* Framework for rapid experimentation without risking production stability
