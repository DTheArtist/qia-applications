## Challenge  
Chi’Va needed to evolve from a proof-of-concept into a secure, enterprise-grade
neurotech platform—capable of handling protected health data, real-time
AI-driven workflows, and rapid user-base growth, all without ballooning
infrastructure costs.

## Strategy  
* Map every user journey to a services layer and data boundary.  
* Adopt a **layered cloud pattern**—isolating the AI engine, secure data lake,
  and compliance pipeline behind API gateways.  
* Embed “governance-by-design”: infrastructure as code, automated PHI
  encryption, audit-trail logging, and least-privilege IAM policies.

## Execution  
1. **Modular micro-services** on AWS Fargate + Lambda for elastic scale.  
2. **Secure data lake** (S3 + Lake Formation) partitioned by tenant and epoch.  
3. **Compliance pipeline** that hashes every event to an immutable ledger
   (AWS QLDB) and auto-generates HIPAA access reports.  
4. **Observability stack** (OpenTelemetry → Grafana) surfacing SLO drift and
   inference latency in real time.  
5. CI/CD with automated threat-model tests and drift detection.

## Outcomes  
* Platform now serves **10 × user load** with **&lt;150 ms median latency**.  
* Passed third-party HIPAA audit on first attempt—zero critical findings.  
* Reduced monthly cloud spend **38 %** through right-sizing and spot-instance
  strategies.  
* Engineering cycle time dropped from weekly to **daily** deploys via full
  IaC pipeline.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* CTO-level architecture leadership  
* Cloud-native scalability & cost optimisation  
* Built-in compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2 groundwork)  
* Data-informed product decisions through rich observability
