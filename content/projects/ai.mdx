## Challenge  
Building AI features for protected-health-data workloads demands airtight
compliance _and_ careful cost control; most teams manage one or the other but
rarely both.

## Strategy  
* Treat compliance as a **first-class engineering concern**: policy-as-code,
  automated audits, immutable logs.  
* Embed **cost-aware routing**—select models and hardware dynamically by
  security tier, latency target, and budget.  
* Maintain an end-to-end **traceability map** linking prompts, model versions,
  and PHI transformations.

## Execution  
1. Integrated AWS KMS + VPC endpoints to ensure PHI never left encrypted
   boundaries during inference.  
2. Implemented a **model-selection broker** that chooses GPT-4o, Claude, or
   an on-premise distilled model based on sensitivity and token budget.  
3. Wired OpenTelemetry spans to capture prompt, response, latency, and dollar
   spend—surfacing live dashboards and alert thresholds.  
4. Automated quarterly HIPAA and SOC 2 evidence packs, generated directly from
   pipeline metadata.

## Outcomes  
* Passed HIPAA compliance renewal with zero remediation tasks.  
* Held average inference cost to **≤ $0.09 per user session**, a 45 % drop
  versus baseline.  
* Reduced security-review cycle time from three weeks to four days thanks to
  traceable, policy-as-code artifacts.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated  
* Regulated-AI architecture (HIPAA, SOC 2)  
* Inference-cost governance & dynamic model routing  
* Audit-ready observability across the entire AI lifecycle
